There are 4 source file and one head file.
1. head.h 
	header file, containing all the global variables and all other header files needed.
2. lib.c
	containing all the capital functions implementaion.
3. tcpd.c
	implement the tcp deamon program, the server side and client side version are both in this single file.
4. ftpc.c
	client, send file to server.
5. ftps.c
	server, receive file from client.

To compile the program, just type make in command line.

Although the arguments for ftpc and ftps are same as in Lab2, but actually the IP and port number for communication between those applications are hardcoded.

Here are all the hardcoded port number and IP address
 TCPDC_LOCAL_PORT 10002
 TROLL_PORT 10003
 TCPDS_REMOTE_PORT 10004
 FTPS_PORT 10005
 LOCALHOST "127.0.0.1"

Test machine will be the localhost machine, i.e. all five applicaitons run on local machine.
